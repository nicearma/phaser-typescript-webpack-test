# phaser webpack typescript test

This day i sow https://phaser.io and i try it, because we are at 2017, i did not wanted to code in simple js, so i try webpack + typescript, but this configuration was not well explain, so i make my own configuration

You will found the last "tutorial" example implement in typescript, with webpack configuration

(This a very simple configuration, nothing to complicated, write in typscript and use webpack to get one js file)

For run the example you need nodejs and you need to execute:

`npm install` -> This one will install all the libraries needed

`npm run webpack` -> will create the bundle.js (you will see that index.html use it)

Get the src folder (the app.ts in not needed) and run it in you default server (you can use node, but i like to stay simple for the moment)

Disclaimer: I have nothing to do with the phaser projet, i only like it and i wanted to share what i did to make it work with webpack + typescript
