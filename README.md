# phaser webpack typescript test

This day i sow https://phaser.io and i try it, because we are at 2017, i did not want to code in simple js, so i try webpack + typescript, but this configuration was not well explain, so i make my own try and i found this

You will found the last "tutorial" example implement in typescript, with webpack configuration

(This a very simple configuration, nothing to complicated)

For run the example you need to execute

`npm install` -> This one will install all the libraries needed

`npm run webpack` -> will create the bundle.js (you will see that index.html use it)

And get the src folder (the app.ts in not needed)

And run it in you default server (you can use node, but i like to stay simple for the moment)
